# Live Digit Recognition Using CNN 

This project is an interactive digit classifier that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It features a sketchpad interface built with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) and is deployed live on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Features: 
- **Deep CNN Architecture** with BatchNormalization and Dropout for robust performance.
- **Real-Time Inference** using a Gradio sketchpad for interactive predictions.
- **Data Augmentation** during training to improve generalization on messy, unseen input.
- **Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces** for live demonstration and ease of access.

## Live Demo: 
[Try it out on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rezaenayati/Live_Digit_Recognition_Using_CNN)

Just draw a digit and hit Submit.  
The model will return the top 3 guesses along with their confidence scores.
