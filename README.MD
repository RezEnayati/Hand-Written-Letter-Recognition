# Handwritten Digit Cassifier with Gradio + TensorFlow 

In this Project I created a live handwritten letter recognition. You can draw a digit from 0-9 in the Gradio Sketchpad and get a prediction in real-time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the EMNIST dataset.

## Overview
In this project I built a handwritten digit recognition using both a Dense Neural Network and CNNs. I tested with different amount of layers and units and
